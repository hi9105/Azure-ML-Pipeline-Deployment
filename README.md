# Operationalizing Machine Learning

## Project Overview
In this project, we will work with the Bank Marketing dataset. We will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. We will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline.

In this project, we will following the below steps:

- Authentication
- Automated ML Experiment
- Deploy the best model
- Enable logging
- Swagger Documentation
- Consume model endpoints
- Create and publish a pipeline
- Documentation

## Key Steps

### Step 1: Authentication

In this step, we will install the Azure Machine Learning Extension which allows you to interact with Azure Machine Learning Studio, part of the az command. After having the Azure machine Learning Extension, we will create a Service Principal account and associate it with our specific workspace.

### Step 2: Automated ML Experiment
